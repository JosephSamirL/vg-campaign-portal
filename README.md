# Client Campaign Portal

A multi-tenant campaign portal for three brands (Kilele Rides, Karoo Coaches, Marrakech Express) built for the Velocity Growth Growth-Engineer build task. Each brand's marketing team signs in, sees only its own contacts, campaigns and dashboard, sends a campaign through the messaging provider, watches delivery reports come back, and can publish one campaign's results behind a password-protected link.

**Live:** https://vg-campaign-portal.vercel.app

## Stack

- **Next.js 16.3** (App Router, `proxy.ts` for session refresh) on **Vercel**
- **Supabase**: Postgres 17 with row-level security, Auth (email + password, Google), Cron (pg_cron + pg_net), Edge Functions
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui**
- **Vitest** (app-level tests) + **pgTAP** via `supabase test db` (database-level tests)
- Node 22 (`.nvmrc`), pnpm

The deployed app uses only the publishable key; the service-role key and the provider key never reach Vercel or the browser.

## Local development

```bash
nvm use                      # Node 22
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL + NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
supabase start               # local Postgres/Auth/Functions in Docker
pnpm dev                     # http://localhost:3000
```

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm test` | Vitest (`tests/**/*.test.ts`) against the local stack |
| `pnpm test:db` | pgTAP suites in `supabase/tests/` |
| `pnpm seed` | Loads the seed data (see *Seed load counts*) |
| `pnpm schema:dump` | Regenerates `schema.sql` from `supabase/migrations/*.sql` |
| `pnpm gen:types` | Regenerates `lib/database.types.ts` from the local database |
| `supabase db push` | Applies migrations to the hosted project |

`schema.sql` at the repo root is the reproducible database definition: it is the concatenation of every migration, in order.

## Manual Auth settings

_Filled in by the auth stories._

## Exposed schemas

The Data API (PostgREST) exposes only `public` and `graphql_public` — `supabase/config.toml` `[api] schemas = ["public", "graphql_public"]` locally, and the same list under Project Settings → Data API → Exposed schemas on the hosted project.

`internal` (plpgsql helpers) and `staging` (raw seed rows) are created by `supabase/migrations/0000_grants.sql` with no `usage` for `public`, `anon` or `authenticated`. **They must never be added to the hosted Data API exposed schemas.** Nothing is ever created in `graphql_public`.

`0000_grants.sql` also revokes Supabase's default privileges in `public`: new functions carry no `execute` for `public`/`anon`/`authenticated`, new tables and sequences carry nothing for `anon`/`authenticated`. Every grant is therefore explicit and visible in `schema.sql`.

## What we tried to break

_Grows with every attack test that lands._

- **anon reads `brands`** — `set role anon; select * from public.brands;` → `ERROR: permission denied for table brands`. The role holds no privilege on the table (RLS is not what stops it — there is nothing to filter); `0000_grants.sql` revoked the default table grant before the table existed and `0001_tenancy.sql` grants `select` to `authenticated` only.
- **anon calls the isolation primitive** — `set role anon; select public.current_brand_id();` → `ERROR: permission denied for function current_brand_id`. Default `execute` for `public`/`anon`/`authenticated` was revoked in `0000_grants.sql`; `0001_tenancy.sql` re-revokes explicitly and grants `execute` to `authenticated` only (same for `current_app_role()`, and `app_users` behaves like `brands`).
- **authenticated without a linked `app_users` row** — `set role authenticated; select count(*) from public.brands;` → `0`. Allowed, but `auth.uid()` is null, `current_brand_id()` returns null, and the forced-RLS policy `id = (select current_brand_id())` matches nothing. Zero rows, never a default brand.

## Seed load counts

_Filled in after the seed load._

## Table / function inventory

_Filled in as migrations land._
